Tarryn is his name.</p>\n<p>Otto(Luke) second to arrive, Ogre.</p>\n<p>I then enter, radiantly.</p>\n<p>Followed by Mozzi(Charlie), mongrelfolk, 5ft, with a mechanical rat wtf</p>\n<p>Finally, Nym (Phil’s character).</p>\n<p>Mozzi - Light green skin, mottled pale white like scarred. Just over 5ft tall, out of one side of the head is a horn. Sharp chin, large bulbous nose. Large hands. Short human in stature.</p>\n<p>Large tattered leather coat, brim around the face. Under the coat looks like a very worn fancy garment, plain trousers hide boots. Seems to be hunched over. He tries to hide it, but obviously under the coat he has 2 more arms that are crossed behind his back. Mozzi has a pet mechanical rat named Lodo.</p>\n<p>Nym - Very pointy angular features, red and purple eyes. Dark black skin, slicked back short white hair. Finely made clothes, black/purple midnight coat. Dark blues and grey for the rest of the clothes. Small scar on the left side of his face. On his belt, a skull like mask, one side gold and one side silver, one side smiling one side grimacing.</p>\n<p>Otto - Half ogre, yellowish brown skin, two small lower tusks, soft brown eyes. Dark hair. Naturally a big boi. Just under 8ft, just under 400lbs. Interestingly, wearing fine looking clothing. A large signet ring on a necklace around his neck.</p>\n<p>Tarryn - Tall and spindly, hidden by many many coats in a technicolour fashion. Massive hat, with a fucking huge feather coming out of it. Long red hair in a pony tail. Pretty boi. Massive lute around his back. His backpack wheezes as he drops it.</p>\n<p>Quest!</p>\n<p>Explorers from the explorers guild have gone missing trying to search through an elven tomb. There were 3 from the explorers guild, and 3 hired adventurers. They haven’t come back and we’re being hired to bring back their tags, if not bring them back alive.</p>\n<p>He gives us a map, pointing west. We’re heading to Baergaden.</p>\n<p>Explorer’s guild members who went missing:</p>\n<p>Pilana Halfbeat - Halfling</p>\n<p>Kudan Mundan - Orc</p>\n<p>Philak Greydak - Dwarf</p>\n<p>3000 gp each for a reward. 5% goes to Jonah.</p>\n<p>6 days travel.</p>\n<p>On the 14th day Jonah will meet us back at the PigNMilk.</p>\n<p>Mozzi explains that he has guns! Crazy</p>\n<p>We take the map he’s given us.</p>\n<p>We head to the Big Leak tavern, a local dive bar.</p>\n<p>Travelling west we will go through a town called Vraddak. It’s a town with a bridge in it for going over the river. Anlak is the Mayor. Pridemount family kind of own it. Sounds shady.</p>\n<p>We sleep in the Big Leak, and wake up the next day, eat breakfast, and pick up some rations for the journey. And we head out on the open road!!!</p>\n<p>During the first night, in Nym’s middle watch, around 8 dark figures approached the camp but not directly looking. They passed by but may be something. They were definitely trying to be hidden.</p>\n<p>Mine and Mozzi’s watch passed uneventfully.</p>\n<p>We travel on for 5 days and eventually approach a river with a bridge, leading directly into the town of Vraddak. Vraddak appears walled and gated.</p>\n<p>The first inn we find is the Cobblers House, and we enter.</p>\n<p>The party we’re looking for definitely passed through this town, and even this bar.</p>\n<p>Tarryn gathers some serious information in the town about the explorer’s guild party.</p>\n<p>After 6 days of travel we eventually reach our destination. Their camp is now ruined, hard to tell exactly what tore it down whether its nature or animals.</p>\n<p>We start descending down into the tomb!</p>\n<p>We come across 7 bodies eventually. 3 of the individuals were are looking for, 4 of them are elves but not desiccated, look like they may be wild elves.</p>\n<p>As we investigate they rise!</p>\n<p>Turns out turn undead is really cool.</p>\n<p>Combat ends soon after!</p>\n<p>SESSION END!!</p>",

One more is chosen to be voice of the high archmage, making 31 members + high archmage.</p>\n<p>Relative peace across the realm. Big divide between upper and lower class. No free schooling so rich get richer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Civilized law mostly, death penalty exists for most dangerous individuals.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Most cities have the Mage Guard, guards policing and investigation. Most council members spend a few years in Mage Guard, to then rise up.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Most crimes go to court. Jury duty full time job.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Towns/Villages differ, most have a mayor chosen by the regions capital. The mayors word is law in these smaller settlements.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Quest Brokers - work individually dealing with problems that Mage Guard don't have time to investigate. Some are illigitimate.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><u><strong>Orgs and Guilds</strong></u></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Mage Guard - Read above</p>\n<p>Air Guild - All Things Airships. Run on purple crystals from underdark?</p>\n<p>Commerce Guild - Bankers and Investors. Sometimes divination to predict the future stonks</p>\n<p>Inquisition - aka Internal Affairs/Watchmen. They check yoself before you wreck yo self if you mage bad things</p>\n<p>Smiths Guild - Arms dealers. Mostly from Baergaden Province. Stronk</p>\n<p>Assasins Guild - Who are they? Nobody knows</p>\n<p>Noble Masons - Like Scientology maybe, except they're descendants of the old Emperor.</p>\n<p>Criminal Empires - We &lt;3 Crime and Mafia</p>\n<p>Wild Elf Conclave - Treehugers anonymous. Don't fuck with their trees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Threats to the East!? o_0</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Ok so to the east is another continent with a weird name and weirder creatures.</p>\n<p>Iguadelv (IG WA DELVE) is Rexan Empire + Kingdom of Throns.</p>\n<p>Rexan Empire is lizardfolk who are mega stronk and love war and magic.</p>\n<p>Kingdom of Thorrns is elf/fae and they have a forest like creep in starcraft 2.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These guys might look our way one day if they get bored.</p>\n<p>OH ALSO BTW THERE ARE FUCKING ROBOTS ON THAT CONTINENT TOO. The Metal Initiative, which is very Terminator 2. They hate us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>What's West?</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A big jungle that's what. Maybe snake gods. They turn up to take slaves some times I'm sure its fine.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><u><strong>Provinces</strong></u></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Majoris</em> - Home of the Capital, Kessen. All sorts of town and cities in here. Obvs a lot in Kessen which is large and in charge.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Estersea</em> - Eastern most. They keep lots of look out for threats from the east. They're a proud and stern lot, mostly elves. Think of it like the wall from game of thrones, except the wall is the sea.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Baergaden</em> - Western. Lots of mountains, lots of dwarves and underground dwarfy holes. Also underdark. Also sounds like Beer Garden.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Grunvak</em> - To the north east. Pretty seclduded peoples. They don't have much to worry about militarily which gives them loads of time to become bitter and resentful about giving up land a long time ago. Get serious MAGA vibes.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Naroon </em>- North. They get raided by the underdark a lot. It makes them very suspect of people. They also farm a lot.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Oldon </em>- South. They defend against the Soverignty (more on them later). Lots of fighting here.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Tranquil Hills</em> - Here we mad chillin. So much so that people hate that they mad chillin. Also there's a drug called Tranquil too, so that's cool.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Traskan</em> Sovereignty - Ok so we've got this guy Vanick, who thinks he's the descendant of the Emperor, so they're trying to make traska great again by removing the council of mages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Ghost </em>- Sounds spooky. Low population because the pesky jungle people from the west keep nicking them to be slaves. Not cool man.</p>",

It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.",

Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell’s range, not the weapon’s normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.",
