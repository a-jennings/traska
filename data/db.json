Tarryn is his name.</p>\n<p>Otto(Luke) second to arrive, Ogre.</p>\n<p>I then enter, radiantly.</p>\n<p>Followed by Mozzi(Charlie), mongrelfolk, 5ft, with a mechanical rat wtf</p>\n<p>Finally, Nym (Phil’s character).</p>\n<p>Mozzi - Light green skin, mottled pale white like scarred. Just over 5ft tall, out of one side of the head is a horn. Sharp chin, large bulbous nose. Large hands. Short human in stature.</p>\n<p>Large tattered leather coat, brim around the face. Under the coat looks like a very worn fancy garment, plain trousers hide boots. Seems to be hunched over. He tries to hide it, but obviously under the coat he has 2 more arms that are crossed behind his back. Mozzi has a pet mechanical rat named Lodo.</p>\n<p>Nym - Very pointy angular features, red and purple eyes. Dark black skin, slicked back short white hair. Finely made clothes, black/purple midnight coat. Dark blues and grey for the rest of the clothes. Small scar on the left side of his face. On his belt, a skull like mask, one side gold and one side silver, one side smiling one side grimacing.</p>\n<p>Otto - Half ogre, yellowish brown skin, two small lower tusks, soft brown eyes. Dark hair. Naturally a big boi. Just under 8ft, just under 400lbs. Interestingly, wearing fine looking clothing. A large signet ring on a necklace around his neck.</p>\n<p>Tarryn - Tall and spindly, hidden by many many coats in a technicolour fashion. Massive hat, with a fucking huge feather coming out of it. Long red hair in a pony tail. Pretty boi. Massive lute around his back. His backpack wheezes as he drops it.</p>\n<p>Quest!</p>\n<p>Explorers from the explorers guild have gone missing trying to search through an elven tomb. There were 3 from the explorers guild, and 3 hired adventurers. They haven’t come back and we’re being hired to bring back their tags, if not bring them back alive.</p>\n<p>He gives us a map, pointing west. We’re heading to Baergaden.</p>\n<p>Explorer’s guild members who went missing:</p>\n<p>Pilana Halfbeat - Halfling</p>\n<p>Kudan Mundan - Orc</p>\n<p>Philak Greydak - Dwarf</p>\n<p>3000 gp each for a reward. 5% goes to Jonah.</p>\n<p>6 days travel.</p>\n<p>On the 14th day Jonah will meet us back at the PigNMilk.</p>\n<p>Mozzi explains that he has guns! Crazy</p>\n<p>We take the map he’s given us.</p>\n<p>We head to the Big Leak tavern, a local dive bar.</p>\n<p>Travelling west we will go through a town called Vraddak. It’s a town with a bridge in it for going over the river. Anlak is the Mayor. Pridemount family kind of own it. Sounds shady.</p>\n<p>We sleep in the Big Leak, and wake up the next day, eat breakfast, and pick up some rations for the journey. And we head out on the open road!!!</p>\n<p>During the first night, in Nym’s middle watch, around 8 dark figures approached the camp but not directly looking. They passed by but may be something. They were definitely trying to be hidden.</p>\n<p>Mine and Mozzi’s watch passed uneventfully.</p>\n<p>We travel on for 5 days and eventually approach a river with a bridge, leading directly into the town of Vraddak. Vraddak appears walled and gated.</p>\n<p>The first inn we find is the Cobblers House, and we enter.</p>\n<p>The party we’re looking for definitely passed through this town, and even this bar.</p>\n<p>Tarryn gathers some serious information in the town about the explorer’s guild party.</p>\n<p>After 6 days of travel we eventually reach our destination. Their camp is now ruined, hard to tell exactly what tore it down whether its nature or animals.</p>\n<p>We start descending down into the tomb!</p>\n<p>We come across 7 bodies eventually. 3 of the individuals were are looking for, 4 of them are elves but not desiccated, look like they may be wild elves.</p>\n<p>As we investigate they rise!</p>\n<p>Turns out turn undead is really cool.</p>\n<p>Combat ends soon after!</p>\n<p>SESSION END!!</p>",

They don't have much to worry about militarily which gives them loads of time to become bitter and resentful about giving up land a long time ago. Get serious MAGA vibes.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Naroon </em>- North. They get raided by the underdark a lot. It makes them very suspect of people. They also farm a lot.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Oldon </em>- South. They defend against the Soverignty (more on them later). Lots of fighting here.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Tranquil Hills</em> - Here we mad chillin. So much so that people hate that they mad chillin. Also there's a drug called Tranquil too, so that's cool.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Traskan</em> Sovereignty - Ok so we've got this guy Vanick, who thinks he's the descendant of the Emperor, so they're trying to make traska great again by removing the council of mages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Ghost </em>- Sounds spooky. Low population because the pesky jungle people from the west keep nicking them to be slaves. Not cool man.</p>",

Otto is slightly injured, but nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>We carry on down the corridor deeper in the tomb. There are tombs built into the walls in the side where there are assumed bodies. Also on the walls the elven designs and inlay get more intricate as we go further down.</p>\n<p>The next room we enter has two sarcophagi on the left and right.<br>\nI get super spooked at this point and cast Detect Undead. It doesn't show any undead in the area so we continue. Spooky!</p>\n<p>We're going deeper underground dun dun!<br>\n <br>\nWe come across another room with like 16 sarcophagi in it. Fucking bollucks blew my load too early. Just enough detect undead to not find any undead in this room.</p>\n<p>We continue and continue, and give Mozzi a big telling off for looting, he stops.<br>\n <br>\nMe and Nym are holding up the rear of the party when this big slop of meat falls on us. These skin kites tear off part of our skin and we suffer 4 points of Charisma damage. What in the actual fuck, not cool man! They try to fly off and multiply, but Otto has other plans... and kills them both with attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>We enter the boss room (I hope). Its a squarish room, with 3 normal looking skeletons, and 1 maybe boss skeleton? Who knows.<br>\nThere are 8 sarcophagi with who knows what the fuck is going on there. And then at the back of the room are two massive crossed swords blocking some sort of entrance? Looks dangerous.<br>\nI went for a nervous shit, because you know fear, and when I came back Otto had fucking annhiliated the room! Noice!<br>\nHowever he's also taking a fucking shit tonne of damage from this ghoul like creature, which eventually paralyzes him, no bueno.<br>\nEventually the creature falls.<br>\n <br>\nFor a little bit, at least, until Nym accidently triggers a trap and the ghoul reforms right fucking next to me! Less than ideal!</p>\n<p>Tarryn almost dies, but he's all fucking good for sure... no worries at all..</p>\n<p>We take a little short rest, so Mozzi can repair guns and for a little cry.<br>\nWe continue down the corridor, until we hit the definite fucking boss chamber now. Inside we see a figure:<br>\n <br>\nShort form, long dark hair learning over a table. They seem to be taking pieces of undead bodies, and kind of build a bearing some sort of undead creature. Fuck my actual life.<br>\n <br>\nThis bitch throws a bone and then goes invisible. What the fuck is that? The bone then turns into a skeleton I guess?!?!<br>\nTarryn reveals here with some glitter, and I charge in and blow my full load all over her face, Sun domain turn undead at max rolls. She gives 0 fucks about this situation.<br>\n <br>\nIt starts to look real bad. It's very bad when Otto gets pushed underground by this fucking she deamon and entombed...<br>\n <br>\nThe fight continues, it comes close to pain as she's summoning skeletons and shit. Eventually killed by Otto<br>\n <br>\nLord Evenor is the top tomb of this place. Tarryn recognises that this lord is old, before the time of the empire. We need to get the fuck out of here!<br>\nAlthough we do loot his tomb, and come across a purple gem of doom.</p>\n<p>We run! As we leave the tomb oh fucking great we're surrounded by elves, bows drawn. 'We need to talk' the main dude says. Fuck my ass</p>",

His pals are drawn.</p>\n<p>Speaks in Elven to Nym. They really fucking hate Nym. Elves hate black people.<br>\nThey search all of us, and Mozzi gives up the gem after kind of accidentally showing it. Again, to stress it, they FUCKING HATE Nym! Then they let us leave, thank you so much.</p>\n<p>We make camp, before going through Vraddak. Me and Nym heal up our Charisma damage thank god, and eventually we end up back in Kessan. <br>\nWE NAME OURSELVES<strong> THE PEDIGREE CHUMS!!</strong></p>\n<p>We decide that we're going to celebrate with a big night out in the Big Leak tavern.</p>\n<p>Tarryn and Otto have a drinking competition, because, you know. DnD. <br>\nWe all wake up the next day in various states of hungover, and head to the hospitatlity district to the Pig N Milk to meet up with Jonah!<br>\n <br>\nThe most epic moment ever. Mozzi spends his epic point, to retroactively actually steal the purple gem, which he pulls out in front of Jonah. Fucking hilarious, but potentially &nbsp;fucking dangerous. The gem is extremely magical, and possibly a soul gem from the underdark.<br>\n <br>\nI spend my off time (a couple of months) in the temple.</p>\n<p>Neccos Kalarys <em>(Neck Oss)</em>- Golden dragonborn, high priestess of Pelor. I spend a lot of time with her during the off months. One of the most powerful people in this city.<br>\nAppearance, 6andhalf feet, radiating light and warmth, Arabian accent. Meeting with her in the temple, she explains that Pelor is shining down upon me. Pelor wants me to fucking roam bitch, samesies. <br>\n <br>\nShe thinks that I would be best suited to be travelling around in the world, bringing Pelor's will to the needy. Also she requests to be able to call on me should the need arise.<br>\n <br>\nWE LEVEL UP TO OUR NEXT CHARACTERS HERE!!<br>\n <br>\nHired by Stefan Gallows via Jonah, part of the neighbourhood watch of Kremix. Hired because 3 dissapearances in this tiny village, and agreed to meet him in the Bugbear's Delight tavern. Northwest of Kessan, 4 days or so walk. Close to the river. People appear to hate us in this town for some reason. 5000gp per person!<br>\n <br>\nWe meet up with a grey haired, scragily loooking Stefan. Brown glove with silver studs on the knuckles? He says since 12 days ago, 4 people have gone missing. Upgraded from 3.</p>\n<p>- Tamlyn Dock, human 40 something, long dark hair quite gaunt looking. Farmer. Left the tavern one evening 12 days ago, never seen again! NorthWest on a farm I assume.</p>\n<p>- Levena Draska, Elf traveller. She stayed in a different pub Farm Hands Rest. But she never arrived at that tavern. Found her cloak and staff. Dissapeared at night</p>\n<p>- Kravena Kragstilt - Dwarf. Returning from farmlot. Farmus Bodge last saw her, left late in the dark. 6 days ago. Also at night A FUCKING PATTERN</p>\n<p>- Drizza Kalop - Half Elf. Left this inn late 2 days ago. He was about 50.</p>\n<p>The Mayor of this town doesn't like adventures. Idiot. Town guard of which there are like 10-12, don't really like us either appaz.<br>\nSo we make a plan(?) to try and find out more information about these dissapearances.</p>\n<p>Me Nym and Otto attempt to go the market to buy/distract. One of the guards stops us and doesn't like us at all! Tells us to not cause trouble. We head to a farm to get more information / bless crops.</p>\n<p>Tarryn gets questioned too. Somehow goes from bad to good! Mozzi hiding the whole time.</p>\n<p>Mozzi finds some shit near where Levana's stuff was found. Taking his time he starts to find some tracks, even through the cobblestone. It all leads to a fucking well. Of course it fucking does. Fuck you. Also nearby there are some steps going down to a sealed iron gate.</p>\n<p>We have a run in with a fucking yokel farmer. Who after much shit talk, eventually find out that potentially some kind of crazy giant spider. Oh joy. Massive spider potentially bigger than Otto.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A long time later! We make a plan to kill this spooky spider in the well. Its gonna be gross</p>",

Also the mayor is just a straight up asshole and definitely is probably 100% evil for sure maybe.<br>\n <br>\nWe open the gate eventually, and we start the sewer dungeon crawl. Mozzy tries to speak to a rat. It doesn't go well. Also it smells a lot like rotting flesh down here.<br>\n <br>\nWe end up in an open cavern, fighting some carion crawlers, and some other doggy like underdark beasties. It's getting pretty gross down here, especially when Otto gets fucking paralyzed!<br>\nWhy is underdark beasties here? We ain't nowhere near it.

I go to the shop the 'Healing Wave' to buy my wand of cure mod wounds. The shopkeeper is a female with blue tinted skin, white eyes, long white braided hair over a shoulder. Tall woman. I've never seen this type of creature before <em>(Meta: It's a water genasi)</em>. She closes the book she's reading, and I see she has webbed fingers. Ardor Crisp.<br>\nI buy the wand, but before I leave I check her for a religious symbol and she used to wear a ring dedicated to Ehlonna, goddess of Forests, Woodlands, Flora, Fauna, and Fertility.<br>\nWe all head then to the Above Board Under Dark shop, with the drow shopkeeper. She. Fucking. Haaaaaates. Me! I buy my shit and run out before I cause a domestic.<br>\n <br>\nMore time passes, we chillin. At one point we get teamed up with the Mage Guard, who no one seems to fucking like. We start becoming heroes up in dis bish.<br>\nJonah messages Nym mentally that he's been kidnapped! We need to go to Vraddak to get him. He also says there's a big bonus!!</p>\n<p>We try to get Get to teleport us, but it's gonna cost way too much and we'd have to do trips. Sounds fucking stupid, so we buy a horse and carriage. Nym goes and buys some spells scrolls from Ardor at the Healing Wave.<br>\n <br>\nWe start out travels! AND WE GET TO THE END OF THE FLASHBACK SAT AROUND THE CAMPFIRE!!</p>\n<p>We enter Vraddak, and saddle our carriage. We head to the pub in Vraddak that we've been to before. Inside we see a woman who sort of looks like a pirate. Hey, she has a gun! Also a white eye in on her coat. She's part of the fucking inquisition! Oh shiiiiiitt</p>",

Tarryn dislikes this decision, but him and Nym come and sit down next to me!<br>\nTarryn plays some reeeall crazy word chess with this woman, where basically she says, she can't do any thing official but knows of some things maybe going down in this town. So it would be nice if we could do something.<br>\nShe's a well known watchman/inquisitor, for taking down a corrupt councillor in the past.<br>\n<br>\nShe fucking knows we stole the elf soul gem.

It's a red moon blocking out the sun. An object twice my height and width, framed in the sun is in front of me. Possibly an eye?! Big blood moon eclipse... I'm in a strange town I don't recognise. NOT COOL MAN! Fucking visions and shit.</p>\n<p>Nym is the first awake, cos elf. A woman enters the bar in distress. Her son vinny, is very ill apparently. Fatigued, and now mute?<br>\n<br>\nWe go and visit this kid, very thin, haggard. Generally not good. Nym detects a magic aura around the child with no specific magic school. We judge that he might live for another 4-5 days, but it's not looking good.<br>\nI try a lesser restoration. Doesn't do a lot but maybe cures some of his fatigue.<br>\nI then use sending, to try and communicate with this child.</p>\n<p>'Can't sleep, someone watching, nightmare's too real and too scary. I dont want to sleep, something is out to get me. Please help' is the reply... Fuck...</p>\n<p>We do try and detect if there is something invisible in the room with us but there is nothing there.</p>\n<p>Explain to Charlotte, the mother, that we've done all that we can for the moment. And we start heading to the temple of Pelor. It's quiet... too quiet...</p>\n<p>Then two shadowy hooded figures come out and block our way... Its combat time!!<br>\nCall an ambulance! Call an ambulance!!! But not for me!<br>\nWe literally slaughter them in seconds. It's fucking hilarious. They picked the wrong house fool.<br>\nWe loot: Magic leather, wand of something, 1000gp, A potion of who knows, a scroll, thug jewellery stash.<br>\nScroll is a tri cast spell: Locate creature, Illusory Terrain, Dimensional Anchor.<br>\nArmour is +2 leather<br>\nWand of Melfs acid arrow with 16 charges.<br>\n<br>\nWe end the session, surrounding a freshly woken up human bandit man which are we going to question... violently?&nbsp;</p>",

He doesn't know a lot of interesting shit, but he does tell us that apparently there is another group of dodgy robed men, and they're the one who kidnapped Jonah.<br>\nWe also find out that the major guy appaz worships an evil Deity named: Hextor.<br>\nI also cast speak with dead on the other dead guy who was murdered before we got there. He really knows fuck all, except the only good thing we get out of him is that they dont know why Vinny is ill/sick<br>\n <br>\nWe visit the temple. Meet Father Arven. Half-Elven. We ask him about healing Vinny. The father calls the group 'The Peddlers'.</p>\n<p>Our only other lead is someone at the temple of Boccob who is investigating what ails young Vinny. We meet Priest Oleryn, who is a pretty old Pai Mei looking motherfucker. He gives us a scroll of See Invisibility which lets us look into the ethereal plane!! Potential saviour for the boy!<br>\n <br>\nOn our way back to move Vinny to the temple of pelor for safety, one of the guard, the actual guard, approaches us. The mayor wants to meet us in his office! This should be fun... We say we will but we're gonna move the boy first.<br>\n <br>\nThen... we fucking do it... we head to the mayors office...We're let in.</p>\n<p>We come to the mayor. Plated dwarven guy with a mean stare. Flanked by two other guys in full plate and shields. They seem to be overly geared. Like they're ready for war. Way over the money value expected. Large grand room.</p>\n<p>He wants us to kill someone big who's been fucking with his men. Killing him. Likely the big motherfucker who killed the other guy, from the end of last session. It's all getting a bit hostile in here...... He also says: 'Get that beak bastard out of here...' What the fuck is the beak about!? We left on a very tense note and head to back to the temple of Pelor.</p>\n<p>Tarryn goes out to investigate and gather some information. Comes back with info about this 'big guy' who's deffo a vigilante who is attacking the mayors men. Tall, broad, similar to Otto in size. Except its some kind of monster, some people say it flys from rooftop to rooftop, or skulking in alleyways with red eyes. Loves to SMASH FACES IN FUCK YEAH. No one has survived contact with this individual, and no one has spoke to him.</p>\n<p>Info on kidnapping: Few over the past few years. Info by word of mouth, no one seems to have seen it happen in action. Very hush hush and mysterious. Seems to be always people who are visiting from outside of town. Beaked Individual? Some people have seen a beaked figure, once in a blue moon. A lot of the dissapearences happen just after his spotting. Long brownish hair description, with a plague doctor style mask. Plain robes. No one has really spoken to him, but has grey cold eyes appaz...<br>\n <br>\nFuck...</p>\n<p>Back in to real life... we rest... staying up casting detect magic to try and see the strange spirit. IT FUCKING HAPPENS. BIG SCARY AURA AROUND THE YOUNGUN.</p>\n<p>Nym casts See invisibility from the scroll that was given to us and its gross. This ethereal figure bent over the boy, this ethereal energy being pulled from the boy into this strange female creature. As Nym calls out the figure looks out towards him. Nym recognises the creature as a Night Hag.<br>\nNight Hag information: Have the ability to travel the ethereal plane. Known for attacking people in their sleep, draining their constitution. Take the form of humanoids, live nearby, take on forms of females or young children. To find the Night Hag in the material plane, should be nearby with no animals nearby, and a foul smell around.<br>\nIf we take her heartstone then she can't go etheral and also its worth a pretty penny.<br>\n<br>\nMozzi and Nym go out to ask the rats where they would never go to try and find the night hags position. Potentially near the docks.<br>\nThey also then ask questions about the big vigilante thing. PSYCH its literally fucking right behind them. Potentailly a gargoyle. Fucking terrifiying</p>",

It's a snake with a lady face. Gross! Also it possesses Mozzi, and tells him that he reeeaaalllllyyy wants to shoot Nym in the face. So he tries!

All is good in the world right? right?<br>\n <br>\nWRONG!<br>\n <br>\nThere's a barrow? cave? thing that looks pretty spooky. Its kind of maybe dug into, and then its pretty spooky corridor with unknown writing. It's fucking spooky? Some sort of fiery gate murial? I'm glad I'm not down there is all I know. The more stealthy of us see some reaaaaal shit.<br>\n <br>\nAnyway... EMERGENCY! The fucking lady of the lake is here... Actually she's not bad? Question mark? She kidnapped Richard, to bring someone here to deal with the naga + trogladytes? Questionable decision but that's fine. We're trying to decide whether we're coming back to investiagte this, but regardless we get Richard back to his wife! Quest complete!!!<br>\n <br>\nWHY THE FUCK DID WE GO BACK! So as I read the text with spells now, First it says there's a God buried here? None that we know of. After the mural it starts speaking about calamity and betrayal?

Apparently casting divination spells on powerful casters can kind of feedback and make you pass out.<br>\nEither way, we decide we need to get her out of the street. A couple of us take her to the temple of Pelor, while a couple go to the temple of Boccob, to try and see if the father mage there can possibly help?</p>\n<p>No. They can't help. Her intelligence might be zero with no way of restoring it? Not sure what to do about dat..</p>\n<p>We're trying to decide what our next moves are.</p>\n<p>Pebs wakes up. Missing an arm. Sadge. He also has savage cuts on his chest. Cut with the beaky boy sword which he said drained him of power.</p>\n<p>Beaky boy description -&gt; Fancy looking robes. Beak mask only covering the mouth, quite long. Eyes visible, sunken eyes. No elven ears. Broad and muscular. Pebs says that he was 'off'. A description that is pretty much backed up as Tarryn goes around asking about the fight they had.</p>\n<p>Also by the sounds of it, the beaky boy was toying with our boy Pebs before fucking him up. Then he twiddled something on his finger and teleported away. Cannot fucking wait to pry that ring of his cold dead hands.</p>\n<p>Nym tries to go to the temple of Boccob to do some research but the library there is pretty shite. So on his stroll back he has a though that the reason Lydia is fucked is because the beak boy is a psionic being? And wait... is he using the beak mask over his mouth to HIDE FUCKING TENTICLES. FUCKING NO PLEASE.</p>\n<p>We rest on this potentially terrible news.<br>\n <br>\nIn the morning the father of the temple of Boccob comes to the temple of Pelor and casts See Invisibility, to check if it's a similar situation to Vinny before. It's not.</p>\n<p>Our decision then, is to get to Mawsgate as fast as we can. The best route we can think of is to go to Byton, and try and catch an airship to Mawsgate. We buy horses for everyone except for Otto because crushing, and he can basically travel the same speed. We buy as much rations as we need, and take off! Leaving Lydia behind in the temple of Pelor hoping she recovers at some point.</p>\n<p>Byton!! We arrive! It appears to be really fucking chill here. Nice place, pretty relaxed because we sit on Lake Tranquil. Around 20 minutes travelling through the town we come to the literal 'Air-Port', where there's like 30 or so airships, with all sorts of carts and shit coming in and out. Major trade up in here. Also there's deffo some smuggling of Tranquil the drug going on in here. From descriptions, it's like Weed+.</p>\n<p>We fuck off our horses because cba. Then we hire an airship for a hunny g each. Sorry Otto we took 100g off your character sheet because fairness.</p>\n<p>Captain Vasinil Alendar, is a female drow. The ship is named Underdark and Beyond. Now I see why Nym found this one ;)</p>\n<p>So I ask the captain about maybe getting a center room for Otto because he's heavy, and it turns out we can balance out the weight of the ship because there's a fucking TROLL ON THE SHIP.</p>\n<p>4 days or so travel to Mawsgate, time for chillin. Nym goes and ask the captain to see if she knows anything about Psionics. They also talk about some drow shit, but I'm not there so I don't hear it. It definitely sounds fucking terrible though. Not that I'd know.</p>\n<p>We continue on without much trouble and we arrive at Mawsgate! It's a two-tiered city, built into the side of a mountain. Part of the city is walled, and it also sprawls out past the walls.</p>\n<p>As we descend in the airship, I notice a very specific statue as part of a well? Its the fucking statue from my dreams...

There's a conversation that some people are having, but I can't really hear what it's about. Eventually the office door opens, and a few very posh people come out. Dwarf, posh boi who turns up his nose. Another Dwarf (Lovid), who looks fucking done. A female human who has a librarian-esque appearance. Finally, a female drawf who moves with purpose.</p>\n<p>She enjoys our card, and our intro but her back gets up when we say that we're here for inquisitorial business.<br>\nGretin Ironslag, is the mayor! She seems a bit more chill when we explain our selves a bit more. But doesn't seem to know much about the beaky boi.</p>\n<p>Rollock Zaks, is the captain of the guard here. Apparently they have a little black market problem, but doesn't know too much about the special healing potions. So we might be able to help out with that.</p>\n<p>But other than that the mayor seems actually pretty chill, and willing to help us! Sick. But doesn't know much information.</p>\n<p>ITS SUN SANCTUARY TIME BABBBYYYY</p>\n<p>Female Gnome behind the altar, blond hair, praying. Livolla. We have a kind of strange conversation, but she doesn't seem to know a lot.

Saved.</p>\n<p>We're gonna find these mother fuckers</p>\n<p><u>No Hard Evidence but here are the names:</u></p>\n<p>Treadorn Lightfoot &nbsp;- Halfling Bard - Plays at Mountain Respite. (Coldwalk district)</p>\n<p>Ullovon Desolant - Halfelf - Works in Cure Moderate Meats.</p>\n<p>Dulva Steelgrate - Dwarf - Volunteers at Trade District temple of Moradin.</p>\n<p>Verkis Jenkz - Gnome Wizard - Studies at Trickdown Magic Academy.</p>\n<p>Potentially these peeps have something to do with the black market, so therefore might know more information where the beaky is, or something about his potions...<br>\n <br>\n <br>\nWe decide to split into two teams, Team Clean, comprised of me and Nym, and Team Dirty. We're staggering our visit to the Mountain Respite, so that Team Dirty can try and get in with the halfling bard.</p>\n<p>I ask Nym some questions about what the drow captain said to him, potential danger in the Underdark incoming? But Nym doesn't want to speak about it until we're in super private. We follow after shortly.</p>\n<p>Team Dirty join the rowdy setting of the Mountain Respite.</p>\n<p>Ok I forgot to write notes but a fucking shit tonne happened...</p>\n<p>Team Dirty, noticed the bard was doing some cool music playing, but also flipping around and stealing peoples stuff. Pretty cool. Until he does it to Mozzi. Not cool.<br>\nTarryn makes a distraction after the performance is over and Mozzi follows him up the stairs doing his best ring girl impression. It does not go to plan. The bard gives him a cheeky smirk so you know he's a baddie.</p>\n<p>Plan starts off with Team Dirty staying here, and maybe speaking to the bard in the morning? Buuuuuuuuttt... Mirrin starts shouting extreme danger at Nym.</p>\n<p>Sounds outside of people being gutted, and meniacal laughter...</p>\n<p>Hey yo, remember when I spoke to Nym about if anything he spoke about was potentially a threat to us?<br>\nYEAH, YEAH....<br>\nNym's brother has arrived.</p>\n<p>Khaine - Nym's brother? Full Drow. Looking proper evil. Nicknamed The Kinslayer...</p>\n<p>Umbris - Nym's Sister, Nicknamed the Invisible blade</p>\n<p>Vilna - Nym's Sister? She's the calm one question? Maybe. She's named the Reign of Arrows</p>\n<p>Combat.</p>\n<p>Holy shit Mozzi and Otto fucked up Khaine and Umbris big time. They're both ending this fight without heads. As Nym coup de grace Khaine, he screams out in pain searing from his back and has a strange purply light coming from below his armour? The fuck? Also he picks up Khaine's dark black scary sword that definitely doesn't talk to him. But he's screaming in pain continuously.</p>\n<p>We dispatch with the rest of the Drow, mostly except for <strong>Vilna who runs away big time</strong>. This isn't gonna come back and bite us in the future.</p>\n<p>Nym's dead siblings kind of turn into dust and kind of get swallowed by Nym?! Uhhhhhhh</p>\n<p>FIN</p>",

Very fortunate I get off a blindness spell, which is fucking permanent in this edition? Hello.<br>\nAt that point she's pretty much defeated. Time for Nym to do his thing. She looks like she's giving up, but they're speaking in undercommon, so I have no idea what the fuck is going on.<br>\nShe tries one last attempt to get a boot dagger, but no dice.

Because of the spell flower, he can hold the charge on both of these spells at the same time. If he casts another spell with a somatic component (which requires the use of one of his hands), he immediately loses one of his held touch spells (his choice), but if the spell he casts is also a touch spell, he can immediately hold the charge in the available hand. If he chooses to attack with a touch spell, it works normally. Since he has multiple limbs that are considered armed, he can make an off-hand attack with the other touch spell in the same round, with the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons (PH 160).</p>\n<p>A marilith spellcaster could do the same as the sorcerer in the previous example, except that she could hold the charge on up to six touch spells. She could also use any of her spell-like or supernatural bilities, since those do not interfere with holding a charge.<br>\nIf the spell flower effect ends, the most recent touch spell cast remains as a held charge and all other held spells dissipate.&nbsp;</p>",
