Tarryn is his name.</p>\n<p>Otto(Luke) second to arrive, Ogre.</p>\n<p>I then enter, radiantly.</p>\n<p>Followed by Mozzi(Charlie), mongrelfolk, 5ft, with a mechanical rat wtf</p>\n<p>Finally, Nym (Phil’s character).</p>\n<p>Mozzi - Light green skin, mottled pale white like scarred. Just over 5ft tall, out of one side of the head is a horn. Sharp chin, large bulbous nose. Large hands. Short human in stature.</p>\n<p>Large tattered leather coat, brim around the face. Under the coat looks like a very worn fancy garment, plain trousers hide boots. Seems to be hunched over. He tries to hide it, but obviously under the coat he has 2 more arms that are crossed behind his back. Mozzi has a pet mechanical rat named Lodo.</p>\n<p>Nym - Very pointy angular features, red and purple eyes. Dark black skin, slicked back short white hair. Finely made clothes, black/purple midnight coat. Dark blues and grey for the rest of the clothes. Small scar on the left side of his face. On his belt, a skull like mask, one side gold and one side silver, one side smiling one side grimacing.</p>\n<p>Otto - Half ogre, yellowish brown skin, two small lower tusks, soft brown eyes. Dark hair. Naturally a big boi. Just under 8ft, just under 400lbs. Interestingly, wearing fine looking clothing. A large signet ring on a necklace around his neck.</p>\n<p>Tarryn - Tall and spindly, hidden by many many coats in a technicolour fashion. Massive hat, with a fucking huge feather coming out of it. Long red hair in a pony tail. Pretty boi. Massive lute around his back. His backpack wheezes as he drops it.</p>\n<p>Quest!</p>\n<p>Explorers from the explorers guild have gone missing trying to search through an elven tomb. There were 3 from the explorers guild, and 3 hired adventurers. They haven’t come back and we’re being hired to bring back their tags, if not bring them back alive.</p>\n<p>He gives us a map, pointing west. We’re heading to Baergaden.</p>\n<p>Explorer’s guild members who went missing:</p>\n<p>Pilana Halfbeat - Halfling</p>\n<p>Kudan Mundan - Orc</p>\n<p>Philak Greydak - Dwarf</p>\n<p>3000 gp each for a reward. 5% goes to Jonah.</p>\n<p>6 days travel.</p>\n<p>On the 14th day Jonah will meet us back at the PigNMilk.</p>\n<p>Mozzi explains that he has guns! Crazy</p>\n<p>We take the map he’s given us.</p>\n<p>We head to the Big Leak tavern, a local dive bar.</p>\n<p>Travelling west we will go through a town called Vraddak. It’s a town with a bridge in it for going over the river. Anlak is the Mayor. Pridemount family kind of own it. Sounds shady.</p>\n<p>We sleep in the Big Leak, and wake up the next day, eat breakfast, and pick up some rations for the journey. And we head out on the open road!!!</p>\n<p>During the first night, in Nym’s middle watch, around 8 dark figures approached the camp but not directly looking. They passed by but may be something. They were definitely trying to be hidden.</p>\n<p>Mine and Mozzi’s watch passed uneventfully.</p>\n<p>We travel on for 5 days and eventually approach a river with a bridge, leading directly into the town of Vraddak. Vraddak appears walled and gated.</p>\n<p>The first inn we find is the Cobblers House, and we enter.</p>\n<p>The party we’re looking for definitely passed through this town, and even this bar.</p>\n<p>Tarryn gathers some serious information in the town about the explorer’s guild party.</p>\n<p>After 6 days of travel we eventually reach our destination. Their camp is now ruined, hard to tell exactly what tore it down whether its nature or animals.</p>\n<p>We start descending down into the tomb!</p>\n<p>We come across 7 bodies eventually. 3 of the individuals were are looking for, 4 of them are elves but not desiccated, look like they may be wild elves.</p>\n<p>As we investigate they rise!</p>\n<p>Turns out turn undead is really cool.</p>\n<p>Combat ends soon after!</p>\n<p>SESSION END!!</p>",

No free schooling so rich get richer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Civilized law mostly, death penalty exists for most dangerous individuals.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Most cities have the Mage Guard, guards policing and investigation.

They're a proud and stern lot, mostly elves. Think of it like the wall from game of thrones, except the wall is the sea.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Baergaden</em> - Western. Lots of mountains, lots of dwarves and underground dwarfy holes. Also underdark. Also sounds like Beer Garden.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Grunvak</em> - To the north east. Pretty seclduded peoples. They don't have much to worry about militarily which gives them loads of time to become bitter and resentful about giving up land a long time ago.

They also farm a lot.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Oldon </em>- South. They defend against the Soverignty (more on them later). Lots of fighting here.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Tranquil Hills</em> - Here we mad chillin. So much so that people hate that they mad chillin. Also there's a drug called Tranquil too, so that's cool.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Traskan</em> Sovereignty - Ok so we've got this guy Vanick, who thinks he's the descendant of the Emperor, so they're trying to make traska great again by removing the council of mages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Ghost </em>- Sounds spooky.

Otto is slightly injured, but nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>We carry on down the corridor deeper in the tomb. There are tombs built into the walls in the side where there are assumed bodies. Also on the walls the elven designs and inlay get more intricate as we go further down.</p>\n<p>The next room we enter has two sarcophagi on the left and right.<br>\nI get super spooked at this point and cast Detect Undead. It doesn't show any undead in the area so we continue. Spooky!</p>\n<p>We're going deeper underground dun dun!<br>\n <br>\nWe come across another room with like 16 sarcophagi in it. Fucking bollucks blew my load too early. Just enough detect undead to not find any undead in this room.</p>\n<p>We continue and continue, and give Mozzi a big telling off for looting, he stops.<br>\n <br>\nMe and Nym are holding up the rear of the party when this big slop of meat falls on us. These skin kites tear off part of our skin and we suffer 4 points of Charisma damage. What in the actual fuck, not cool man! They try to fly off and multiply, but Otto has other plans... and kills them both with attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>We enter the boss room (I hope). Its a squarish room, with 3 normal looking skeletons, and 1 maybe boss skeleton? Who knows.<br>\nThere are 8 sarcophagi with who knows what the fuck is going on there. And then at the back of the room are two massive crossed swords blocking some sort of entrance? Looks dangerous.<br>\nI went for a nervous shit, because you know fear, and when I came back Otto had fucking annhiliated the room! Noice!<br>\nHowever he's also taking a fucking shit tonne of damage from this ghoul like creature, which eventually paralyzes him, no bueno.<br>\nEventually the creature falls.<br>\n <br>\nFor a little bit, at least, until Nym accidently triggers a trap and the ghoul reforms right fucking next to me! Less than ideal!</p>\n<p>Tarryn almost dies, but he's all fucking good for sure... no worries at all..</p>\n<p>We take a little short rest, so Mozzi can repair guns and for a little cry.<br>\nWe continue down the corridor, until we hit the definite fucking boss chamber now. Inside we see a figure:<br>\n <br>\nShort form, long dark hair learning over a table. They seem to be taking pieces of undead bodies, and kind of build a bearing some sort of undead creature. Fuck my actual life.<br>\n <br>\nThis bitch throws a bone and then goes invisible. What the fuck is that? The bone then turns into a skeleton I guess?!?!<br>\nTarryn reveals here with some glitter, and I charge in and blow my full load all over her face, Sun domain turn undead at max rolls. She gives 0 fucks about this situation.<br>\n <br>\nIt starts to look real bad. It's very bad when Otto gets pushed underground by this fucking she deamon and entombed...<br>\n <br>\nThe fight continues, it comes close to pain as she's summoning skeletons and shit. Eventually killed by Otto<br>\n <br>\nLord Evenor is the top tomb of this place. Tarryn recognises that this lord is old, before the time of the empire. We need to get the fuck out of here!<br>\nAlthough we do loot his tomb, and come across a purple gem of doom.</p>\n<p>We run! As we leave the tomb oh fucking great we're surrounded by elves, bows drawn. 'We need to talk' the main dude says. Fuck my ass</p>",

His pals are drawn.</p>\n<p>Speaks in Elven to Nym. They really fucking hate Nym. Elves hate black people.<br>\nThey search all of us, and Mozzi gives up the gem after kind of accidentally showing it. Again, to stress it, they FUCKING HATE Nym! Then they let us leave, thank you so much.</p>\n<p>We make camp, before going through Vraddak. Me and Nym heal up our Charisma damage thank god, and eventually we end up back in Kessan. <br>\nWE NAME OURSELVES<strong> THE PEDIGREE CHUMS!!</strong></p>\n<p>We decide that we're going to celebrate with a big night out in the Big Leak tavern.</p>\n<p>Tarryn and Otto have a drinking competition, because, you know. DnD. <br>\nWe all wake up the next day in various states of hungover, and head to the hospitatlity district to the Pig N Milk to meet up with Jonah!<br>\n <br>\nThe most epic moment ever. Mozzi spends his epic point, to retroactively actually steal the purple gem, which he pulls out in front of Jonah. Fucking hilarious, but potentially &nbsp;fucking dangerous. The gem is extremely magical, and possibly a soul gem from the underdark.<br>\n <br>\nI spend my off time (a couple of months) in the temple.</p>\n<p>Neccos Kalarys <em>(Neck Oss)</em>- Golden dragonborn, high priestess of Pelor. I spend a lot of time with her during the off months. One of the most powerful people in this city.<br>\nAppearance, 6andhalf feet, radiating light and warmth, Arabian accent. Meeting with her in the temple, she explains that Pelor is shining down upon me. Pelor wants me to fucking roam bitch, samesies. <br>\n <br>\nShe thinks that I would be best suited to be travelling around in the world, bringing Pelor's will to the needy. Also she requests to be able to call on me should the need arise.<br>\n <br>\nWE LEVEL UP TO OUR NEXT CHARACTERS HERE!!<br>\n <br>\nHired by Stefan Gallows via Jonah, part of the neighbourhood watch of Kremix. Hired because 3 dissapearances in this tiny village, and agreed to meet him in the Bugbear's Delight tavern. Northwest of Kessan, 4 days or so walk. Close to the river. People appear to hate us in this town for some reason. 5000gp per person!<br>\n <br>\nWe meet up with a grey haired, scragily loooking Stefan. Brown glove with silver studs on the knuckles? He says since 12 days ago, 4 people have gone missing. Upgraded from 3.</p>\n<p>- Tamlyn Dock, human 40 something, long dark hair quite gaunt looking. Farmer. Left the tavern one evening 12 days ago, never seen again! NorthWest on a farm I assume.</p>\n<p>- Levena Draska, Elf traveller. She stayed in a different pub Farm Hands Rest. But she never arrived at that tavern. Found her cloak and staff. Dissapeared at night</p>\n<p>- Kravena Kragstilt - Dwarf. Returning from farmlot. Farmus Bodge last saw her, left late in the dark. 6 days ago. Also at night A FUCKING PATTERN</p>\n<p>- Drizza Kalop - Half Elf. Left this inn late 2 days ago. He was about 50.</p>\n<p>The Mayor of this town doesn't like adventures. Idiot. Town guard of which there are like 10-12, don't really like us either appaz.<br>\nSo we make a plan(?) to try and find out more information about these dissapearances.</p>\n<p>Me Nym and Otto attempt to go the market to buy/distract. One of the guards stops us and doesn't like us at all! Tells us to not cause trouble. We head to a farm to get more information / bless crops.</p>\n<p>Tarryn gets questioned too. Somehow goes from bad to good! Mozzi hiding the whole time.</p>\n<p>Mozzi finds some shit near where Levana's stuff was found. Taking his time he starts to find some tracks, even through the cobblestone. It all leads to a fucking well. Of course it fucking does. Fuck you. Also nearby there are some steps going down to a sealed iron gate.</p>\n<p>We have a run in with a fucking yokel farmer. Who after much shit talk, eventually find out that potentially some kind of crazy giant spider. Oh joy. Massive spider potentially bigger than Otto.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A long time later! We make a plan to kill this spooky spider in the well. Its gonna be gross</p>",

Me and Tarryn go to speak to the head of the guard, who is a large orc fella. Some talking ensues, and we go to visit the Mayor at his house!</p>\n<p>Mayor is a gnome, Gildrek Loken. Sat in a chair way to big for him. He might not like us. Motherfucking monocle.<br>\nI'm still fucking confused as to why they hate us. They hate us cos they aint us<br>\n <br>\nWe signed a document saying we wont cause a ruckus. Also the mayor is just a straight up asshole and definitely is probably 100% evil for sure maybe.<br>\n <br>\nWe open the gate eventually, and we start the sewer dungeon crawl. Mozzy tries to speak to a rat. It doesn't go well. Also it smells a lot like rotting flesh down here.<br>\n <br>\nWe end up in an open cavern, fighting some carion crawlers, and some other doggy like underdark beasties. It's getting pretty gross down here, especially when Otto gets fucking paralyzed!<br>\nWhy is underdark beasties here? We ain't nowhere near it. Its bad juju</p>\n<p>Carrying on, we enter what looks to be the big boss cavern... Uh oh!</p>",

Takes over a grapple he's in, and then fucking Hulk vs Loki's him around the room.<br>\nAlthough Otta and Mozzi go down which gets a little spicy but we all survive.</p>\n<p>The Cussy (Cave pussy) goes down into the underdark apparently!? Which is super fucked up because it shouldn't be here.<br>\nThe bodies are all here and very dead. Tarryn starts writing a note explaining this shit situation to the Goblin mayor.</p>\n<p>So eventually we leave and head back to Kessen! Much gold get, Drinks are had, Prayers to Pelor are completed.<br>\nThe rest of the chums go shopping while I pray and shit. They meet Get Aetris, at the Enchanting Enchanter store where they get lots and lots of upgrade. Oh and like a month and a half passes while we do minor stuff and dat.<br>\n <br>\nMy adventure! I go to the shop the 'Healing Wave' to buy my wand of cure mod wounds. The shopkeeper is a female with blue tinted skin, white eyes, long white braided hair over a shoulder. Tall woman. I've never seen this type of creature before <em>(Meta: It's a water genasi)</em>. She closes the book she's reading, and I see she has webbed fingers. Ardor Crisp.<br>\nI buy the wand, but before I leave I check her for a religious symbol and she used to wear a ring dedicated to Ehlonna, goddess of Forests, Woodlands, Flora, Fauna, and Fertility.<br>\nWe all head then to the Above Board Under Dark shop, with the drow shopkeeper. She. Fucking. Haaaaaates. Me! I buy my shit and run out before I cause a domestic.<br>\n <br>\nMore time passes, we chillin. At one point we get teamed up with the Mage Guard, who no one seems to fucking like. We start becoming heroes up in dis bish.<br>\nJonah messages Nym mentally that he's been kidnapped! We need to go to Vraddak to get him. He also says there's a big bonus!!</p>\n<p>We try to get Get to teleport us, but it's gonna cost way too much and we'd have to do trips. Sounds fucking stupid, so we buy a horse and carriage. Nym goes and buys some spells scrolls from Ardor at the Healing Wave.<br>\n <br>\nWe start out travels! AND WE GET TO THE END OF THE FLASHBACK SAT AROUND THE CAMPFIRE!!</p>\n<p>We enter Vraddak, and saddle our carriage. We head to the pub in Vraddak that we've been to before. Inside we see a woman who sort of looks like a pirate. Hey, she has a gun! Also a white eye in on her coat. She's part of the fucking inquisition! Oh shiiiiiitt</p>",

We remember her being farily friendly from before. We go the bar, and sort out food, drink, rooms and stabling.<br>\nI walk up to the Watchmen Lydia Greymont and introduce myself, she seems nice. Tarryn dislikes this decision, but him and Nym come and sit down next to me!<br>\nTarryn plays some reeeall crazy word chess with this woman, where basically she says, she can't do any thing official but knows of some things maybe going down in this town. So it would be nice if we could do something.<br>\nShe's a well known watchman/inquisitor, for taking down a corrupt councillor in the past.<br>\n<br>\nShe fucking knows we stole the elf soul gem. Fuck my ass.<br>\nEventually she goes to bed, she's got early travels in the morning.</p>\n<p>Also, it appears that the elves that we stole the soul gem from are SUPER PISSED OFF ABOUT THAT and want it back...</p>\n<p>I go to bed after trying a sending spell to Jonah again, but it fails.<br>\nNym goes off to 'enjoy the night life'... which is ominous.<br>\nMozzi goes off into the night and then start speaking to rats in the street. Which actually works! Find out that Jonah was beaten and dragged off days again by 5 hooded men, but unsure where.<br>\nNym did an explore but got followed around by the guards.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnlak Pridemount - Leader of the Pridemount crime family who run and own this town. He is the Mayor, everyone in the town hates him. He's known as a very bad man. The guards are definitely under his control.<br>\n<br>\nI have a dream! What the fuck! It's a red moon blocking out the sun. An object twice my height and width, framed in the sun is in front of me. Possibly an eye?! Big blood moon eclipse... I'm in a strange town I don't recognise. NOT COOL MAN! Fucking visions and shit.</p>\n<p>Nym is the first awake, cos elf. A woman enters the bar in distress. Her son vinny, is very ill apparently. Fatigued, and now mute?<br>\n<br>\nWe go and visit this kid, very thin, haggard. Generally not good. Nym detects a magic aura around the child with no specific magic school. We judge that he might live for another 4-5 days, but it's not looking good.<br>\nI try a lesser restoration. Doesn't do a lot but maybe cures some of his fatigue.<br>\nI then use sending, to try and communicate with this child.</p>\n<p>'Can't sleep, someone watching, nightmare's too real and too scary. I dont want to sleep, something is out to get me. Please help' is the reply... Fuck...</p>\n<p>We do try and detect if there is something invisible in the room with us but there is nothing there.</p>\n<p>Explain to Charlotte, the mother, that we've done all that we can for the moment. And we start heading to the temple of Pelor. It's quiet... too quiet...</p>\n<p>Then two shadowy hooded figures come out and block our way... Its combat time!!<br>\nCall an ambulance! Call an ambulance!!! But not for me!<br>\nWe literally slaughter them in seconds. It's fucking hilarious. They picked the wrong house fool.<br>\nWe loot: Magic leather, wand of something, 1000gp, A potion of who knows, a scroll, thug jewellery stash.<br>\nScroll is a tri cast spell: Locate creature, Illusory Terrain, Dimensional Anchor.<br>\nArmour is +2 leather<br>\nWand of Melfs acid arrow with 16 charges.<br>\n<br>\nWe end the session, surrounding a freshly woken up human bandit man which are we going to question... violently?&nbsp;</p>",

He doesn't know a lot of interesting shit, but he does tell us that apparently there is another group of dodgy robed men, and they're the one who kidnapped Jonah.<br>\nWe also find out that the major guy appaz worships an evil Deity named: Hextor.<br>\nI also cast speak with dead on the other dead guy who was murdered before we got there. He really knows fuck all, except the only good thing we get out of him is that they dont know why Vinny is ill/sick<br>\n <br>\nWe visit the temple. Meet Father Arven. Half-Elven. We ask him about healing Vinny. The father calls the group 'The Peddlers'.</p>\n<p>Our only other lead is someone at the temple of Boccob who is investigating what ails young Vinny. We meet Priest Oleryn, who is a pretty old Pai Mei looking motherfucker. He gives us a scroll of See Invisibility which lets us look into the ethereal plane!! Potential saviour for the boy!<br>\n <br>\nOn our way back to move Vinny to the temple of pelor for safety, one of the guard, the actual guard, approaches us. The mayor wants to meet us in his office! This should be fun... We say we will but we're gonna move the boy first.<br>\n <br>\nThen... we fucking do it... we head to the mayors office...We're let in.</p>\n<p>We come to the mayor. Plated dwarven guy with a mean stare. Flanked by two other guys in full plate and shields. They seem to be overly geared. Like they're ready for war. Way over the money value expected. Large grand room.</p>\n<p>He wants us to kill someone big who's been fucking with his men. Killing him. Likely the big motherfucker who killed the other guy, from the end of last session. It's all getting a bit hostile in here...... He also says: 'Get that beak bastard out of here...' What the fuck is the beak about!? We left on a very tense note and head to back to the temple of Pelor.</p>\n<p>Tarryn goes out to investigate and gather some information. Comes back with info about this 'big guy' who's deffo a vigilante who is attacking the mayors men. Tall, broad, similar to Otto in size. Except its some kind of monster, some people say it flys from rooftop to rooftop, or skulking in alleyways with red eyes. Loves to SMASH FACES IN FUCK YEAH. No one has survived contact with this individual, and no one has spoke to him.</p>\n<p>Info on kidnapping: Few over the past few years. Info by word of mouth, no one seems to have seen it happen in action. Very hush hush and mysterious. Seems to be always people who are visiting from outside of town. Beaked Individual? Some people have seen a beaked figure, once in a blue moon. A lot of the dissapearences happen just after his spotting. Long brownish hair description, with a plague doctor style mask. Plain robes. No one has really spoken to him, but has grey cold eyes appaz...<br>\n <br>\nFuck...</p>\n<p>Back in to real life... we rest... staying up casting detect magic to try and see the strange spirit. IT FUCKING HAPPENS. BIG SCARY AURA AROUND THE YOUNGUN.</p>\n<p>Nym casts See invisibility from the scroll that was given to us and its gross. This ethereal figure bent over the boy, this ethereal energy being pulled from the boy into this strange female creature. As Nym calls out the figure looks out towards him. Nym recognises the creature as a Night Hag.<br>\nNight Hag information: Have the ability to travel the ethereal plane. Known for attacking people in their sleep, draining their constitution. Take the form of humanoids, live nearby, take on forms of females or young children. To find the Night Hag in the material plane, should be nearby with no animals nearby, and a foul smell around.<br>\nIf we take her heartstone then she can't go etheral and also its worth a pretty penny.<br>\n<br>\nMozzi and Nym go out to ask the rats where they would never go to try and find the night hags position. Potentially near the docks.<br>\nThey also then ask questions about the big vigilante thing. PSYCH its literally fucking right behind them. Potentailly a gargoyle. Fucking terrifiying</p>",

Eventually they kind of just let us live!? <br>\nThe flame portal at the back of the room kind of changes into a more stary space instead.</p>\n<p>We enter into a temple? A bird temple?</p>\n<p>Infernia - Goddess of fire. Forogtten temple. Within this stone is some of my power. Calamity is near. She will bestow power to whoever passes her test! And then a feather slowly falls down onto an egg and bazinga. It turns into a fucking pheonix and the test begins! Fuck my ass.</p>\n<p>We defeat the pheonix bird god lady, and a blessing can be given to someone. Otto takes it on! He gets a really cool piece of parchement, with some secret powers on it? Seeeeccreeeetttss. We take a little rest in the previous pre portal chamber.</p>\n<p>WE LEVEL UP<br>\nEND OF ACT 1</p>\n<p>After many days of travel, we arrive back in Kessen!! and we go off to find Jonah in the Pig n Milk. We do a lot of talking with Jonah, and food and drinks are had! And then we get our 10000 gold!! Also Jonah is gonna sell some more stuff, and we're gonna get 16000gp additional after he sells stuff in 2 days.</p>\n<p>We do some drinking in the Big Leak. It gets fucking twisted. We head back to the Pig N milk eventually. Jonah is all kinds of fucked up. He reveals he used to be in the Mageocracy, for 2 years as the shortest serving member. Some of his memories have been removed by them. That's fucked up.<br>\n <br>\nI wake up first, because obviously. Its a bad idea. I get stopped by Captain Lightpass, of the Mage guard, surrounded by a couple more of the guards. They're hear to round us up. We have a conversation to have with a representitive of the elven conclave...<br>\nOff to the governmental tower we go! This gon' be bad.</p>\n<p>Llorofin Venora, the Archmage of foreign affairs, 'greets' us.</p>\n<p>Helafin Sunriver, conclave elf representitive. Moon motifs. Galadriel lite.</p>\n<p>We sort of get out of that situation unscathed? Nice?... <br>\nUntil we get outside.........<br>\nWhat the actual fuck there's some people singing, and then BOOM an explosion out of the Miltiary Tower. What the fuck is going on...

I manage to push the party through, into the carnage, and try and save/heal as many people as possible. Then suddenly a fucking terrorist fireball explosion happens and kills fucking a billion civilians. What the actual fuck</p>\n<p>We leave, silently and solumly. We make our way to somewhere quiet to chat. We find a private room in Kiplings (The Inn) to discuss. It costs a fortune.</p>\n<p>Tarryn wrote the song of the Democratic Liberartion Front, its a movement that believes that Traska should be run by a democracy instead of a mageocracy.</p>\n<p>In the past a big gathering of 50k people, stormed the political tower and arranged a sit in. No violence, until there was. 1000's died on both side. Saw the death of Evelios Gallernoble, an elf whos wife Vola Brokenfang Orc lived and basically starts going crazy trying to get revenge. Radical Turn. Since Volo has run it, acts of terrorism has gone up and targetting anyone if they can fuck with the mageocracy.</p>\n<p>Vola eventually arrested and taken to prison... Is she out now? Its on? 12 years or so timeline.</p>\n<p>This is all kind of fucked up..<br>\nWe take our rest in our private room. Lodo gets repaired!!! Also... ratmen? skaven? bad news.</p>\n<p>I teach Tarryn some celestial through the day.</p>\n<p>Next Day! Shopping adventure. I finally get boots of striding and sprinting! I can fucking moooooovvee. Apparently necklace of fireballs are gonna be banned soon. Also in the attack maybe some potions were used? Emergency?!</p>\n<p>The Water Genasi woman, Ardor Crisp is trying to replicate the potions... Maybe I'll give her one one day...<br>\nWe also all get rings of communication!!</p>\n<p>We buy stabling for the horse and cart for the year. WE BUY A FUCKING FLAT! Lets go. 32nd floor of Halfbreed Heights. The flat is called The Pedigree Pad.</p>\n<p>We meet Jonah in the Pig N Milk, and he confirms that actually way more fucking mage guard got murdered, as the terrorist acts happenend in every tunnel connected to the military district. Also confirmed Vola is out!</p>\n<p>We try to figure out what to do with the potions that are super fucking hot right now, as they were used in the attacks.<br>\n<br>\nEventually, we make the diplomatic decision to hand the hot potions to the Mageocracy... Which I have to now figure out next time on dragonball Z</p>",

Me and Tarryn have a DMC.</p>\n<p>Few days pass.</p>\n<p>Early in the morning of one these days I recieve a message: \"This is Father Arven from Vraddak. Beak returned. Fought pebs. Pebs okay.

Like the same blood moon again. There's something in front of me. Taking more shape than it did before. Humanoid. Stone like appearance. Cold to the touch. Male voice. 'By his grace, free me, help me'. I spend a few hours on the top of the ship trying to think it out. Much confusion.</p>\n<p>Tarryn has a vision too!

      "text": "<p>It's been a while...</p>\n<p>So Lydia is super passed out. Some sort of feedback from casting this divination spell? Apparently casting divination spells on powerful casters can kind of feedback and make you pass out.<br>\nEither way, we decide we need to get her out of the street. A couple of us take her to the temple of Pelor, while a couple go to the temple of Boccob, to try and see if the father mage there can possibly help?</p>\n<p>No. They can't help. Her intelligence might be zero with no way of restoring it? Not sure what to do about dat..</p>\n<p>We're trying to decide what our next moves are.</p>\n<p>Pebs wakes up. Missing an arm. Sadge. He also has savage cuts on his chest. Cut with the beaky boy sword which he said drained him of power.</p>\n<p>Beaky boy description -&gt; Fancy looking robes. Beak mask only covering the mouth, quite long. Eyes visible, sunken eyes. No elven ears. Broad and muscular. Pebs says that he was 'off'. A description that is pretty much backed up as Tarryn goes around asking about the fight they had.</p>\n<p>Also by the sounds of it, the beaky boy was toying with our boy Pebs before fucking him up. Then he twiddled something on his finger and teleported away. Cannot fucking wait to pry that ring of his cold dead hands.</p>\n<p>Nym tries to go to the temple of Boccob to do some research but the library there is pretty shite. So on his stroll back he has a though that the reason Lydia is fucked is because the beak boy is a psionic being? And wait... is he using the beak mask over his mouth to HIDE FUCKING TENTICLES. FUCKING NO PLEASE.</p>\n<p>We rest on this potentially terrible news.<br>\n <br>\nIn the morning the father of the temple of Boccob comes to the temple of Pelor and casts See Invisibility, to check if it's a similar situation to Vinny before. It's not.</p>\n<p>Our decision then, is to get to Mawsgate as fast as we can. The best route we can think of is to go to Byton, and try and catch an airship to Mawsgate. We buy horses for everyone except for Otto because crushing, and he can basically travel the same speed. We buy as much rations as we need, and take off! Leaving Lydia behind in the temple of Pelor hoping she recovers at some point.</p>\n<p>Byton!! We arrive! It appears to be really fucking chill here. Nice place, pretty relaxed because we sit on Lake Tranquil. Around 20 minutes travelling through the town we come to the literal 'Air-Port', where there's like 30 or so airships, with all sorts of carts and shit coming in and out. Major trade up in here. Also there's deffo some smuggling of Tranquil the drug going on in here. From descriptions, it's like Weed+.</p>\n<p>We fuck off our horses because cba. Then we hire an airship for a hunny g each. Sorry Otto we took 100g off your character sheet because fairness.</p>\n<p>Captain Vasinil Alendar, is a female drow. The ship is named Underdark and Beyond. Now I see why Nym found this one ;)</p>\n<p>So I ask the captain about maybe getting a center room for Otto because he's heavy, and it turns out we can balance out the weight of the ship because there's a fucking TROLL ON THE SHIP.</p>\n<p>4 days or so travel to Mawsgate, time for chillin. Nym goes and ask the captain to see if she knows anything about Psionics. They also talk about some drow shit, but I'm not there so I don't hear it. It definitely sounds fucking terrible though. Not that I'd know.</p>\n<p>We continue on without much trouble and we arrive at Mawsgate! It's a two-tiered city, built into the side of a mountain. Part of the city is walled, and it also sprawls out past the walls.</p>\n<p>As we descend in the airship, I notice a very specific statue as part of a well? Its the fucking statue from my dreams...

Fucking statue.</p>\n<p>Statue looks human, head bowed kind of short shaved hair.<br>\nGreek looking hoplite armour, muscular with a massive symbol of Pelor carved into the stone chest.</p>\n<p>Tarryn, knows this statues to be Helio, and old champion of Pelor. The story of Helio: Legend says that he still lives, and that he was turned to stone by Medusa. Allegedly he severed her arm, but at that point he was beginning to turn to stone. Tarryn has a song about it that he sings.</p>\n<p>After the song has finished a old looking noble man behind us starts clapping at the song. Rista Noble is his name, he is a travelling historian man? He recommends us a tavern called the Ale of the Banshee.</p>\n<p>He also gives some more info about the statue that he knows of. He thinks that Medusa is still alive. Rumour has it that she resides in the city of Sardus, wherever that is. Maybe embedded in the mountain? Around 45 miles south ish?</p>\n<p>The temple of Pelor here is called the Sun Sanctuary, and I'm erect.</p>\n<p>There's also a Magic Academy. Pog</p>\n<p>I do a wade through the fountain, and go to touch the statue. Big fucking mistake I get a Gandalf vs Ring flash vision of the same thing I saw before and the statue asking to release it. Not cool bro.</p>\n<p>Annyyywayy, bigger fish to fry right now! Beaky boi! We head on over toward the Ale of the Banshee, which is inside the walled city bit, in the trade district. We approach the gate of the walled area, which is heavily guarded, but they're only really looking at the carts going in and out.</p>\n<p>This is our kind of inn baby! Rowdy, lots of other people and blue collars etc. Also seems like there's another adventurer party here... Bartender is a gnomish woman.</p>\n<p>Adventuring party: dwarf man, human man, halfling female, elf female... Can't wait for this.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the barwoman says that maybe a patron saw him a couple months ago? We get rooms food drinks and all that shit.</p>\n<p>The other adventuring party 'killed a white dragon' for sure, no cap. They don't even have a name, fucking lame.</p>\n<p>We eat and drink etc etc, and decide we're gonna try and get some more info. First stop the Trickdown Mage Academy, which is in the emerald eye area. We get stopped by guards on our way there, but we good. The receptionist there is a complete fucking dick on a stick. So fuck the Mage Academy.</p>\n<p>Mozzi does a steal, and doesn't get caught... luckily...</p>\n<p>Aaaaaanyway, next stop is the Mayor's office! There's a conversation that some people are having, but I can't really hear what it's about. Eventually the office door opens, and a few very posh people come out. Dwarf, posh boi who turns up his nose. Another Dwarf (Lovid), who looks fucking done. A female human who has a librarian-esque appearance. Finally, a female drawf who moves with purpose.</p>\n<p>She enjoys our card, and our intro but her back gets up when we say that we're here for inquisitorial business.<br>\nGretin Ironslag, is the mayor! She seems a bit more chill when we explain our selves a bit more. But doesn't seem to know much about the beaky boi.</p>\n<p>Rollock Zaks, is the captain of the guard here. Apparently they have a little black market problem, but doesn't know too much about the special healing potions. So we might be able to help out with that.</p>\n<p>But other than that the mayor seems actually pretty chill, and willing to help us! Sick. But doesn't know much information.</p>\n<p>ITS SUN SANCTUARY TIME BABBBYYYY</p>\n<p>Female Gnome behind the altar, blond hair, praying. Livolla. We have a kind of strange conversation, but she doesn't seem to know a lot. Also this temple, for being called the Sun Sanctuary is a little bit shit.</p>\n<p>Nym and Tarryn also goes and prays at the temple of Corellon... I stay outside...</p>\n<p>FIN</p>",

Pretty cool. Until he does it to Mozzi. Not cool.<br>\nTarryn makes a distraction after the performance is over and Mozzi follows him up the stairs doing his best ring girl impression. It does not go to plan. The bard gives him a cheeky smirk so you know he's a baddie.</p>\n<p>Plan starts off with Team Dirty staying here, and maybe speaking to the bard in the morning? Buuuuuuuuttt... Mirrin starts shouting extreme danger at Nym.</p>\n<p>Sounds outside of people being gutted, and meniacal laughter...</p>\n<p>Hey yo, remember when I spoke to Nym about if anything he spoke about was potentially a threat to us?<br>\nYEAH, YEAH....<br>\nNym's brother has arrived.</p>\n<p>Khaine - Nym's brother?

She's named the Reign of Arrows</p>\n<p>Combat.</p>\n<p>Holy shit Mozzi and Otto fucked up Khaine and Umbris big time. They're both ending this fight without heads. As Nym coup de grace Khaine, he screams out in pain searing from his back and has a strange purply light coming from below his armour? The fuck? Also he picks up Khaine's dark black scary sword that definitely doesn't talk to him. But he's screaming in pain continuously.</p>\n<p>We dispatch with the rest of the Drow, mostly except for <strong>Vilna who runs away big time</strong>.

He was spotted putting some shit on an airship once upon a time. A lead?</p>\n<p>Tarryn and Nym do there deception stuff, and they're meeting up with a dodgy dealer female dwarf (named Steelgrate?) with a symbol that Nym might recognise?

Apparently the Obsidian got spooked...</p>\n<p>And then Tarryn and Otto go into an alleyway... and theres some dark figures.</p>\n<p>And then Me and Nym on the roof see some dark figures on other roofs...<br>\n<br>\nFuck.<br>\n<br>\nRemember for next session: I'm not wearing my normal armour and I have weird ring of 50% ranged dodge.

Looks like they're writing weird flow charts or something to try and prepare for something. Weirdchamp.</p>\n<p>They also have these flow charts that talk about upcoming attacks potentially on Kessen and Mawsgate... Hmmm...<br>\n <br>\nLevel 3, prison is empty now. Not much there</p>\n<p>Level 2. Empty, but the orb... it's so tempting. Nym yolo touches it. He gets a crazy vision, white cliffs, black pyramid, boat graveyard? We all sort of see it, but no one knows where it is. <br>\nThen we go for a group check on it. That's when we see a dark omen. Mawsgate is under attack, complete chaos and death running through the streets. Very cold. Chanting in draconic, 'Vengeance'. It could be a white dragon attack as revenge for that shitty little other party that says they killed a white dragon... might have been a baby... Fuck.<br>\n <br>\nWe head back towards the captains quarters, and there's so many people there getting ready for processing. Fucking paperwork<br>\n <br>\nWe start questioning a guy called Lovid, he might know some shit. He starts making deals to try and get his wife and son safe, fuck that shit we're gonna interview his son because he's deffo involved in all the bad shit. Kid's name is Oslo.</p>\n<p>Oslo is a fuccccccckkiiinnnnggggggg ppprrrriiiiiiccccccckkkkkkkk.<br>\n <br>\nHe's such a fucking noble douche rocket, he thinks he's top shit. He probably knows shit but he doesn't reveal much. Also he a little raaacciisstt.<br>\n <br>\nThis isn't getting far, not sure what the play is. But we think maybe the best thing is to find Lovid's wife, Oslo's mother, because she's a little sussy baka as well. Maybe we can use her as leverage.<br>\n <br>\nWe come to the conclusion after doing a little searchy search that the Obsidian definitely have the wife/mother.<br>\n <br>\nOh my god Tarryn fucking figured it out. The kid doesnt know shit, the Obsidian have kidnapped her and Oslo thought. We have to save her basically. The kid says that sometimes the dad smelt like meat? Cure Moderate Meats is the next stop for shure. <br>\n <br>\nI've bought a Font for scrying for next session to try and locate her, because WE FUCKING LEVEL UP BBAABBBBYYYYYYYY!!!!!!</p>\n<p>I also message Nathaniel, who says my armour will be ready at around noon tomorrow. I can try to get it a bit earlier. The command word is ZENITH</p>",

It's real bad news.<br>\n <br>\nEventually, we find the underpassage to Cure Moderate Meats. Mozzi and Nym go up first, thrown up by Otto. Then Otto throws me, and I spend my epic point to get my armour at the peak. It's a proper anime moment.<br>\n <br>\nLight from the armour allows a bit of vision in the room now. We see what we assume is Beatice in a cage, looking close to death maybes. There's also a guy who just opened the door and have seen us... We roll initiative, but we'll see what happens..<br>\nThis poor peasant man, gets commanded, grappled, gagged and tied... But we also find boxes FULL of contriband shit.

An alarm goes off and we're fucking going for it.</p>\n<p>Alright its fucking fight time, it's kind of like a chess game, trying to dodge the necklaces of fireballs everywhere. Some serious big time work done by Nym and Otto to be fair. Phantasmal Killer plus a crazy head shot with the heavy crossbow. People getting fucked up...<br>\n<br>\nAnd then Opehelia appears and tries to get us to Halt. It literally didnt work against anyone. Lolsies...<br>\n<br>\nBut then...

Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the alternate form special ability, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. Each time you use wild shape, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night.\n\nAny gear worn or carried by the druid melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When the druid reverts to her true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on her body that they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items worn in the assumed form fall off and land at the druid's feet.\n\nThe form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.\n\nA druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)\n\nA druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.\n\nThe new form’s Hit Dice can’t exceed the character’s druid level.\n\nAt 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can’t use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn’t a creature.)\n\nAt 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental’s extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental’s feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.\n\nAt 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.",

      "spellDescription": "<p>You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster’s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.</p><p><em>Note:</em> The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.</p><p>You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:</p><h6>Targeted Dispel</h6><p>One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20</a> + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4</a> rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><h6>Area Dispel</h6><p>When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.</p><p>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s magic items are not affected.</p><p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p><p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.</p><p>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p><p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.</p><p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.</p><h6>Counterspell</h6><p>When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.</p>",

First eliminate the subject’s racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.

Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)</p><p>You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</p><p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action</a>. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.</p><p>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.</p><p>A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.</p><p>Despite its appearance, a wall of thorns is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.</p>",

At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.</p><p>Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for antimagic field.</p><p>You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of air walk (counts as a trick; see Handle Animal</a> check.</p>",
