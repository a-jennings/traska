Tarryn is his name.</p>\n<p>Otto(Luke) second to arrive, Ogre.</p>\n<p>I then enter, radiantly.</p>\n<p>Followed by Mozzi(Charlie), mongrelfolk, 5ft, with a mechanical rat wtf</p>\n<p>Finally, Nym (Phil’s character).</p>\n<p>Mozzi - Light green skin, mottled pale white like scarred. Just over 5ft tall, out of one side of the head is a horn. Sharp chin, large bulbous nose. Large hands. Short human in stature.</p>\n<p>Large tattered leather coat, brim around the face. Under the coat looks like a very worn fancy garment, plain trousers hide boots. Seems to be hunched over. He tries to hide it, but obviously under the coat he has 2 more arms that are crossed behind his back. Mozzi has a pet mechanical rat named Lodo.</p>\n<p>Nym - Very pointy angular features, red and purple eyes. Dark black skin, slicked back short white hair. Finely made clothes, black/purple midnight coat. Dark blues and grey for the rest of the clothes. Small scar on the left side of his face. On his belt, a skull like mask, one side gold and one side silver, one side smiling one side grimacing.</p>\n<p>Otto - Half ogre, yellowish brown skin, two small lower tusks, soft brown eyes. Dark hair. Naturally a big boi. Just under 8ft, just under 400lbs. Interestingly, wearing fine looking clothing. A large signet ring on a necklace around his neck.</p>\n<p>Tarryn - Tall and spindly, hidden by many many coats in a technicolour fashion. Massive hat, with a fucking huge feather coming out of it. Long red hair in a pony tail. Pretty boi. Massive lute around his back. His backpack wheezes as he drops it.</p>\n<p>Quest!</p>\n<p>Explorers from the explorers guild have gone missing trying to search through an elven tomb. There were 3 from the explorers guild, and 3 hired adventurers. They haven’t come back and we’re being hired to bring back their tags, if not bring them back alive.</p>\n<p>He gives us a map, pointing west. We’re heading to Baergaden.</p>\n<p>Explorer’s guild members who went missing:</p>\n<p>Pilana Halfbeat - Halfling</p>\n<p>Kudan Mundan - Orc</p>\n<p>Philak Greydak - Dwarf</p>\n<p>3000 gp each for a reward. 5% goes to Jonah.</p>\n<p>6 days travel.</p>\n<p>On the 14th day Jonah will meet us back at the PigNMilk.</p>\n<p>Mozzi explains that he has guns! Crazy</p>\n<p>We take the map he’s given us.</p>\n<p>We head to the Big Leak tavern, a local dive bar.</p>\n<p>Travelling west we will go through a town called Vraddak. It’s a town with a bridge in it for going over the river. Anlak is the Mayor. Pridemount family kind of own it. Sounds shady.</p>\n<p>We sleep in the Big Leak, and wake up the next day, eat breakfast, and pick up some rations for the journey. And we head out on the open road!!!</p>\n<p>During the first night, in Nym’s middle watch, around 8 dark figures approached the camp but not directly looking. They passed by but may be something. They were definitely trying to be hidden.</p>\n<p>Mine and Mozzi’s watch passed uneventfully.</p>\n<p>We travel on for 5 days and eventually approach a river with a bridge, leading directly into the town of Vraddak. Vraddak appears walled and gated.</p>\n<p>The first inn we find is the Cobblers House, and we enter.</p>\n<p>The party we’re looking for definitely passed through this town, and even this bar.</p>\n<p>Tarryn gathers some serious information in the town about the explorer’s guild party.</p>\n<p>After 6 days of travel we eventually reach our destination. Their camp is now ruined, hard to tell exactly what tore it down whether its nature or animals.</p>\n<p>We start descending down into the tomb!</p>\n<p>We come across 7 bodies eventually. 3 of the individuals were are looking for, 4 of them are elves but not desiccated, look like they may be wild elves.</p>\n<p>As we investigate they rise!</p>\n<p>Turns out turn undead is really cool.</p>\n<p>Combat ends soon after!</p>\n<p>SESSION END!!</p>",

One more is chosen to be voice of the high archmage, making 31 members + high archmage.</p>\n<p>Relative peace across the realm. Big divide between upper and lower class. No free schooling so rich get richer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Civilized law mostly, death penalty exists for most dangerous individuals.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Most cities have the Mage Guard, guards policing and investigation. Most council members spend a few years in Mage Guard, to then rise up.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Most crimes go to court. Jury duty full time job.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Towns/Villages differ, most have a mayor chosen by the regions capital. The mayors word is law in these smaller settlements.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Quest Brokers - work individually dealing with problems that Mage Guard don't have time to investigate. Some are illigitimate.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><u><strong>Orgs and Guilds</strong></u></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Mage Guard - Read above</p>\n<p>Air Guild - All Things Airships.

The Metal Initiative, which is very Terminator 2. They hate us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>What's West?</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A big jungle that's what. Maybe snake gods.

They're a proud and stern lot, mostly elves. Think of it like the wall from game of thrones, except the wall is the sea.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Baergaden</em> - Western. Lots of mountains, lots of dwarves and underground dwarfy holes. Also underdark. Also sounds like Beer Garden.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Grunvak</em> - To the north east. Pretty seclduded peoples. They don't have much to worry about militarily which gives them loads of time to become bitter and resentful about giving up land a long time ago. Get serious MAGA vibes.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Naroon </em>- North. They get raided by the underdark a lot. It makes them very suspect of people. They also farm a lot.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Oldon </em>- South. They defend against the Soverignty (more on them later). Lots of fighting here.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Tranquil Hills</em> - Here we mad chillin. So much so that people hate that they mad chillin. Also there's a drug called Tranquil too, so that's cool.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Traskan</em> Sovereignty - Ok so we've got this guy Vanick, who thinks he's the descendant of the Emperor, so they're trying to make traska great again by removing the council of mages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Ghost </em>- Sounds spooky.

Otto is slightly injured, but nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>We carry on down the corridor deeper in the tomb. There are tombs built into the walls in the side where there are assumed bodies. Also on the walls the elven designs and inlay get more intricate as we go further down.</p>\n<p>The next room we enter has two sarcophagi on the left and right.<br>\nI get super spooked at this point and cast Detect Undead. It doesn't show any undead in the area so we continue. Spooky!</p>\n<p>We're going deeper underground dun dun!<br>\n <br>\nWe come across another room with like 16 sarcophagi in it. Fucking bollucks blew my load too early. Just enough detect undead to not find any undead in this room.</p>\n<p>We continue and continue, and give Mozzi a big telling off for looting, he stops.<br>\n <br>\nMe and Nym are holding up the rear of the party when this big slop of meat falls on us. These skin kites tear off part of our skin and we suffer 4 points of Charisma damage. What in the actual fuck, not cool man! They try to fly off and multiply, but Otto has other plans... and kills them both with attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>We enter the boss room (I hope). Its a squarish room, with 3 normal looking skeletons, and 1 maybe boss skeleton? Who knows.<br>\nThere are 8 sarcophagi with who knows what the fuck is going on there. And then at the back of the room are two massive crossed swords blocking some sort of entrance? Looks dangerous.<br>\nI went for a nervous shit, because you know fear, and when I came back Otto had fucking annhiliated the room! Noice!<br>\nHowever he's also taking a fucking shit tonne of damage from this ghoul like creature, which eventually paralyzes him, no bueno.<br>\nEventually the creature falls.<br>\n <br>\nFor a little bit, at least, until Nym accidently triggers a trap and the ghoul reforms right fucking next to me! Less than ideal!</p>\n<p>Tarryn almost dies, but he's all fucking good for sure... no worries at all..</p>\n<p>We take a little short rest, so Mozzi can repair guns and for a little cry.<br>\nWe continue down the corridor, until we hit the definite fucking boss chamber now. Inside we see a figure:<br>\n <br>\nShort form, long dark hair learning over a table. They seem to be taking pieces of undead bodies, and kind of build a bearing some sort of undead creature. Fuck my actual life.<br>\n <br>\nThis bitch throws a bone and then goes invisible. What the fuck is that? The bone then turns into a skeleton I guess?!?!<br>\nTarryn reveals here with some glitter, and I charge in and blow my full load all over her face, Sun domain turn undead at max rolls. She gives 0 fucks about this situation.<br>\n <br>\nIt starts to look real bad. It's very bad when Otto gets pushed underground by this fucking she deamon and entombed...<br>\n <br>\nThe fight continues, it comes close to pain as she's summoning skeletons and shit. Eventually killed by Otto<br>\n <br>\nLord Evenor is the top tomb of this place. Tarryn recognises that this lord is old, before the time of the empire. We need to get the fuck out of here!<br>\nAlthough we do loot his tomb, and come across a purple gem of doom.</p>\n<p>We run! As we leave the tomb oh fucking great we're surrounded by elves, bows drawn. 'We need to talk' the main dude says. Fuck my ass</p>",

Elves hate black people.<br>\nThey search all of us, and Mozzi gives up the gem after kind of accidentally showing it. Again, to stress it, they FUCKING HATE Nym! Then they let us leave, thank you so much.</p>\n<p>We make camp, before going through Vraddak. Me and Nym heal up our Charisma damage thank god, and eventually we end up back in Kessan. <br>\nWE NAME OURSELVES<strong> THE PEDIGREE CHUMS!!</strong></p>\n<p>We decide that we're going to celebrate with a big night out in the Big Leak tavern.</p>\n<p>Tarryn and Otto have a drinking competition, because, you know. DnD. <br>\nWe all wake up the next day in various states of hungover, and head to the hospitatlity district to the Pig N Milk to meet up with Jonah!<br>\n <br>\nThe most epic moment ever. Mozzi spends his epic point, to retroactively actually steal the purple gem, which he pulls out in front of Jonah. Fucking hilarious, but potentially &nbsp;fucking dangerous. The gem is extremely magical, and possibly a soul gem from the underdark.<br>\n <br>\nI spend my off time (a couple of months) in the temple.</p>\n<p>Neccos Kalarys <em>(Neck Oss)</em>- Golden dragonborn, high priestess of Pelor. I spend a lot of time with her during the off months. One of the most powerful people in this city.<br>\nAppearance, 6andhalf feet, radiating light and warmth, Arabian accent. Meeting with her in the temple, she explains that Pelor is shining down upon me. Pelor wants me to fucking roam bitch, samesies. <br>\n <br>\nShe thinks that I would be best suited to be travelling around in the world, bringing Pelor's will to the needy. Also she requests to be able to call on me should the need arise.<br>\n <br>\nWE LEVEL UP TO OUR NEXT CHARACTERS HERE!!<br>\n <br>\nHired by Stefan Gallows via Jonah, part of the neighbourhood watch of Kremix. Hired because 3 dissapearances in this tiny village, and agreed to meet him in the Bugbear's Delight tavern. Northwest of Kessan, 4 days or so walk. Close to the river. People appear to hate us in this town for some reason. 5000gp per person!<br>\n <br>\nWe meet up with a grey haired, scragily loooking Stefan. Brown glove with silver studs on the knuckles? He says since 12 days ago, 4 people have gone missing. Upgraded from 3.</p>\n<p>- Tamlyn Dock, human 40 something, long dark hair quite gaunt looking. Farmer. Left the tavern one evening 12 days ago, never seen again! NorthWest on a farm I assume.</p>\n<p>- Levena Draska, Elf traveller. She stayed in a different pub Farm Hands Rest. But she never arrived at that tavern. Found her cloak and staff. Dissapeared at night</p>\n<p>- Kravena Kragstilt - Dwarf. Returning from farmlot. Farmus Bodge last saw her, left late in the dark. 6 days ago. Also at night A FUCKING PATTERN</p>\n<p>- Drizza Kalop - Half Elf. Left this inn late 2 days ago. He was about 50.</p>\n<p>The Mayor of this town doesn't like adventures. Idiot. Town guard of which there are like 10-12, don't really like us either appaz.<br>\nSo we make a plan(?) to try and find out more information about these dissapearances.</p>\n<p>Me Nym and Otto attempt to go the market to buy/distract. One of the guards stops us and doesn't like us at all! Tells us to not cause trouble. We head to a farm to get more information / bless crops.</p>\n<p>Tarryn gets questioned too. Somehow goes from bad to good! Mozzi hiding the whole time.</p>\n<p>Mozzi finds some shit near where Levana's stuff was found. Taking his time he starts to find some tracks, even through the cobblestone. It all leads to a fucking well. Of course it fucking does. Fuck you. Also nearby there are some steps going down to a sealed iron gate.</p>\n<p>We have a run in with a fucking yokel farmer. Who after much shit talk, eventually find out that potentially some kind of crazy giant spider. Oh joy. Massive spider potentially bigger than Otto.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A long time later! We make a plan to kill this spooky spider in the well. Its gonna be gross</p>",

Also the mayor is just a straight up asshole and definitely is probably 100% evil for sure maybe.<br>\n <br>\nWe open the gate eventually, and we start the sewer dungeon crawl.

Also it smells a lot like rotting flesh down here.<br>\n <br>\nWe end up in an open cavern, fighting some carion crawlers, and some other doggy like underdark beasties. It's getting pretty gross down here, especially when Otto gets fucking paralyzed!<br>\nWhy is underdark beasties here? We ain't nowhere near it.

Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.</p>\n<p>Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a <a href=\"https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicJar.htm\" title=\"magic jar\"><em>magic jar</em></a> attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as <a href=\"https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/dominatePerson.htm\" title=\"dominate person\"><em>dominate person</em></a>). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of <a href=\"https://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm#alignment\" title=\"alignment\">alignment</a>.</p>\n<p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the <a href=\"https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#naturalWeapons\" title=\"natural weapon\">natural weapon</a> attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. <a href=\"https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellResistance\" title=\"Spell resistance\">Spell resistance</a> can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p>\n<h6><em>Arcane Material Component</em></h6>\n<p>A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.&nbsp;</p>",
